**Fortune Cookie Bot**

The purpose of the fortune cookie bot is to bring a little of magic to the user’s everyday life.
Fortune cookies have served as whimsical ending to dinner at numerous restaurants, but why
go out and wait for your fortune cookie when you could receive it at the touch of a button?
With a playful personality, the bot engages with users and answers their endless questions
about the future, decisions, or just life. Users are greeted with a friendly hello and the quest
begins to find out your fortune. Each fortune goes beyond entertainment and demonstrates the
unpredictability of life in a lighthearted manner.

We used OpenAI to power this bot. For a small fee of $5 dollars, we were able to use OpenAI to
power this bot. Through its capabilities, the bot is able to respond and fuel an interaction. Our
graphics were sourced from Adobe stock, and when listening, the fortune cookie is closed but
while responding the fortune cookie is open.

We thought it would be a fun spin on fortune telling, and it’s also a cute way to present a
chatbot. We didn’t use any special framework other than OpenAI api.
